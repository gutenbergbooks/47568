<h2 id="c2">THE BLUE-HEADED VIREO.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Vireo solitarius.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Blue-headed Vireo, or its varieties,
of which there are several, frequent
nearly the whole of North America. The
typical form of the species, that of our
illustration, has a range covering Eastern
North America and extending westward
to the great plains. It breeds from
Southern New England and the lake
states northward to Hudson Bay and
southward in the higher altitudes of the
Alleghenies. It passes the winter in
Cuba, Mexico and Central America. The
Blue-headed Vireo is frequently called
the Solitary Vireo, or Greenlet, because
of its retiring habits. It is a bird of the
forest and stays very close in these quiet
retreats. Yet it is, as a rule, easy of approach,
seeming to possess both curiosity
and confidence. Mr. Bradford Torrey
writes with enthusiasm regarding the
pretty habits of this bird. He says: &ldquo;Its
most winning trait is its tameness. Wood
bird as it is, it will sometimes permit the
greatest familiarities. Two birds I have
seen which allowed themselves to be
stroked in the freest manner while sitting
on the eggs, and which ate from my hand
as readily as any pet canary; but I have
seen others that complained loudly whenever
I approached their tree. Perhaps
they had had sad experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Possessing a happy and cheerful disposition,
this species, like the other
vireos, sings while working. Listening
to them, we are reminded of the lines in
&ldquo;The Vision of Sir Launfal&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The little birds sang as if it were</p>
<p class="t0">The one day of summer in all the year,</p>
<p class="t">And the very leaves seemed to sing on the trees.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Fortunate, indeed, is he who has the
pleasure of watching this Vireo working
upon its home and uttering &ldquo;inexpressibly
sweet and tender love notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas M. Brewer says that the
Blue-headed Vireo &ldquo;usually makes a nest
of coarse materials somewhat loosely put
together, covering it with lichens, thus
assimilating it to the moss-covered limb
from which it is suspended.&rdquo; The materials
used, however, are not always the
same. One nest, of which Mr. Brewer
speaks, was &ldquo;covered over, as if cemented,
with bits of newspaper.&rdquo; The external
portion of another was &ldquo;composed of the
silky cover of cocoons, woven into a homogeneous
and clothlike fabric, by some
process quite inexplicable.&rdquo; The nests
are frequently constructed of fine bark
fibers, withered grass and pine needles
woven together with moss and lined with
plant down, fine grass and small, fibrous
roots.</p>
<p>Much has been written regarding the
song of this handsome bird of the woods.
The words of Mr. Torrey perhaps best
describe it. He says: &ldquo;The Solitary&rsquo;s
song is matchless for the tenderness of
its cadence, while in peculiarly happy
moments the bird indulges in a continuous
warble that is really enchanting.&rdquo; It
has, too, a musical chatter and a pretty
trilled whistle.</p>
<p>In Mr. Keyser&rsquo;s experience &ldquo;the song
was varied and lively, sometimes running
high in the scale, and had not that absent-minded
air which marks the roundelay
of the warbling vireo. It is much
more intense and expressive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewer describes the song as a
&ldquo;prolonged and very peculiar ditty, repeated
at frequent intervals and always
identical. It begins with a lively and
pleasant warble, of a gradually ascending
scale, which at a certain pitch suddenly
breaks down into a falsetto note. The
song then rises again in a single note and
ceases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The notes of the female suggest to Mr.
Burroughs &ldquo;the bleating of a tiny lambkin.&rdquo;
To Mr. Nuttall &ldquo;its song seems to
be intermediate between that of the red-eyed
and the yellow-breasted species,
having the &lsquo;preai, preai,&rsquo; of the latter and
the fine variety of the former in its
tones.&rdquo; To all &ldquo;the music of the Solitary
Vireo is delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c3">BOOK AND MRS. OYSTER</h2>
<p>At the death of his dear mother little
Willis went from his western farm home
to stay for a few years with his Aunt
Jennie in an eastern seaport town.</p>
<p>One day she had oysters in the shell
for dinner. As his parents had wisely
tried to keep his eyes and ears keen in
regard to common things, he was full of
questions.</p>
<p>His aunt told him that the next time
she bought live oysters she would give
him some to watch and study. Only a
few weeks later she was expecting company
to dinner and had a chance to keep
her word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fill this with water,&rdquo; said she, giving
him a plain glass fruit dish, &ldquo;and put
your oyster in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Willis, &ldquo;oysters live in sea
water, which is salty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; they do live in sea water. In
order to grow and thrive they must have
vegetable and mineral substances found
in sea water. But they can live in fresh
water. Oystermen make a practice of
moving them from their banks to spots
near the mouth of a river where the water
is not nearly so salty or even quite fresh.
Here they get washed out and freshened.
They look plumper and some of the
strong, salty taste being taken away, they
have a more delicate flavor. All the largest
oysters in the market are fattened in
that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willis did as directed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you notice how the oyster is covered?&rdquo;
asked his aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it has two shells which are joined
like a hinge at the smaller end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you notice that they are different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One shell is larger and deeper near
the hinge. The outside of it is white and
pretty. The shelly matter is laid in rings,
some of which seem full, making me
think of a tucked and ruffled skirt. The
other shell is smaller, darker and nearly
flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Bridget if she has some small
crackers to give you one. Powder it and
throw it on top of the water. If she
has none a spoonful of corn meal will
do for food. Animals which are deprived
of natural ways of getting a living must
be supplied with suitable food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had done that she handed
him a pair of shells, in one of which lay
an oyster. &ldquo;Here is another one which
I had opened for you. I am very busy
to-day. While the company is here you
can amuse yourself by watching what
happens. Examine the dead oyster and
find out what you can about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willis was delighted with his odd pet.
He watched the live creature for some
time. At first its two shells were tightly
closed. After being quiet for some time
it cautiously opened its shell a little way
as though it was peeping at him. He
was so pleased that he grabbed his hat
and ran to fetch his neighbor schoolmate,
Joseph. Once in a while a bit of cracker
would be drawn between the shells and,
in time, disappear. The two boys were
very much interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us look at the dead oyster, Willis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking a toothpick in his hand he
tried to turn over the oyster in the shell.
He found that a thickened muscle near
the middle part was fastened to the half
shell. Tearing it loose he saw at this
place a dark, purplish spot just like one
on the other half shell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what makes that hard spot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, see, Joseph! Its body has two
sides. The side lying in the deeper
piece of shell is larger. Down the middle
is a division and the edges come together
something like the cover of a
book. Over all is a white covering with
such pretty frilled edges. See, I can roll
it back quite a little way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so. How pretty it is. It has
no head. Does it eat? I wonder if it has
a mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willis searched carefully for an opening.
At last he found one near the
hinge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; asked Willis, handing
his playmate a little doubled-up thing
about as large as a pea.</p>
<p>After examining it carefully for a moment
Joseph exclaimed: &ldquo;You must have
found its mouth. This is surely a baby
crab which has been swallowed. See its
little legs drawn up to its body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both agreed that they had found a
crab. They again turned their attention
to the oyster&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a large mouth for such a little
animal! See how far I can put the point
of my knife into it. It must have some
bowels. I wonder if its bowels are here
at the larger end. It looks puffy and
dark inside. The thing is so slippery that
I can scarcely handle it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it see, Willis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can find no eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys took the oyster out of the
water several times that they might see
how it looked tucked so snugly between
its shells. Every time they touched it
the opening was closed tight. Thus the
boys spent the afternoon.</p>
<p>When Joseph went home Willis said:
&ldquo;Come over to-morrow and we will get
auntie to tell us more about the oyster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner Willis went to his room
and watched his oyster again until his
eyes drooped.</p>
<p>Presently there was a thump-thump-thumping
across the floor behind him.
What was Willis&rsquo;s surprise to see a big
library book come near and with one
leap place himself on the table. He was
again surprised to see the oyster reach
a long arm out of the water and the
book another long arm from between its
leaves. They two then shook hands.
Both raised themselves to a vertical position
and made a bow to Willis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will try to tell you what you
wish to know. Then you can surprise
Aunt Jennie by telling her some things.&rdquo;
As he spoke Mrs. Oyster swelled herself
up so large that the soft white matter
protruded from the shell; for she
had never before had the high honor
of talking to a real boy.</p>
<p>Willis was so pleased that he clapped
his hands.</p>
<p>Mrs. Oyster crawled up and nicely balanced
herself on the edge of the dish.
Willis was speechless with surprise.</p>
<p>Book spoke: &ldquo;This is Mrs. Oyster.
She belongs to the subkingdom of shellfish
called Mollusca. All of her folks
have soft bodies. As she is protected
by a shell of two parts, she is said to
be a bi-valve. Her relative, Snail,&rdquo; said
he, motioning with his hand, &ldquo;having a
single shell is called a uni-valve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking in the direction of the movement
of Book&rsquo;s hand, what was his surprise
to see a snail with a shell on his
back crawling across the table. Where
he came from, Willis could not tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When looking at that oyster this
afternoon you noticed a thickened portion
fastened to a dark spot on the valve,&rdquo;
said Book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Willis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a muscle,&rdquo; continued Book,
&ldquo;fastened at the dark spot on each valve.
It becomes very strong by use. An oyster
knows how to let it stretch, thus opening
the valves to allow water to enter
his chamber. It also knows how to draw
it up so as to close them to keep out intruders.
The white covering over the
body is called the &lsquo;mantle&rsquo;. If you notice
the inside of an oyster valve, you can
see a mark showing how near to the edge
the mantle came. That is called the pallial
line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will keep on looking you will
succeed in finding that besides a mouth
an oyster has a stomach, liver and intestines,
a nervous system, and a heart that
pumps blood, though it is not red but
white blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you breathe, you take in your
lungs from air what is called oxygen.
Without oxygen there can be no life.
Anything that can not in some way take
in oxygen can not have life. Water as
well as air contains it. Oysters have
no lungs, but they have leaf-like gills on
each side of the body. By means of these
they get oxygen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can an oyster see?&rdquo; asked Willis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has organs of sight, hearing, smelling,
touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are his eyes? We could not
find them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hunt them again,&rdquo; laughed Book. &ldquo;I
think that I will not tell you that. Since
an oyster has no head you must not be
surprised to find them in an odd place.
The dark part which you noticed this
afternoon and which shows so plainly in
a cooked oyster is its great liver.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow I will again try to find
eyes. Perhaps auntie will let me take
her glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping near and pointing as he
talked, Book continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To protect her soft body, friend Mrs.
Oyster&rsquo;s mantle produces a shell of lime
which grows by being enlarged around
the edge. The high point on the left
valve is called the beak. If you will scrub
her shell with a brush to-morrow you
will see lines running around the beak
in the same direction as the margin.
These are called &lsquo;lines of growth.&rsquo; By
them oystermen can tell the age of the
shellfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; said Willis thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Tree trunks also show lines of
growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo; asked
Willis of Mrs. Oyster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I have lived most of my life within
this narrow shell,&rdquo; she answered with
a cast-down air, &ldquo;I have no idea where
I came from nor where I now am. Shall
I tell you the story of my life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do, please. It must be interesting.
You are such an odd creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing I remember,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Oyster after she had drawn a full
breath, &ldquo;is that I was a tiny bit of white
mucus, or egg, as people say, swimming
gayly around with my brothers and sisters
in my mother&rsquo;s shell. It was worse
than in the case of the old woman who
lived in a shoe. There were two or three
thousand of us&mdash;maybe more. At any
rate there were so many of us that our
poor mother never had time to count us.
But she was one who never worried.
To keep us from getting lost she kept
us in by closing her shell tight. That let
her get no food. With a true mother&rsquo;s
spirit she fed us on the substance of her
own body until she became very poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon,&rdquo; said Book. &ldquo;Let me
explain to our friend. At that time the
mucus within the shell in which the
young oysters swim looks milky. The
old oyster, who is said to be in the milk,
is then unfit to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time two weeks had rolled
around,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Oyster, &ldquo;things
in our house began to turn very dark in
color and our mother received a prompt
message from Dame Nature saying that
she must turn us out of her house and
home. Poor mother! She knew that
Dame Nature&rsquo;s orders must be obeyed
or death to the whole family would come.
So she bade us good-bye, gave us a bit
of advice, and opened the door. Knowing
nothing of the size of the world and the
things which happen outside of a shell,
and thinking that we were going out only
for a little romp, we in one voice assured
her that we would not go very far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eagerly we rushed out, to find that
thousands of mothers on that same oyster
bank were also just expelling their little
ones. I became lost from my brothers
and sisters. The water was so full of
myriads of babies like myself that it took
all of my attention to simply keep out of
the way of the crowd. The oyster babies
all looked so much alike that I lost hope
of ever knowing one of my brothers
again. Indeed, I could scarcely tell which
was myself. Our mothers were down
deep, but we rose near the surface where
we could see the beautiful blue sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find anything to eat?&rdquo; asked
Willis with great concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. We found plenty of tiny
animals and specks of vegetables that
eased our hunger and helped us to grow.
After swimming freely for a few days
our shells began to form and we found
ourselves unable to swim long distances.
They soon weighted us down and we
began to sink. I heard a mother oyster
pitifully calling, &lsquo;Baby, baby, come to
mamma.&rsquo; I wondered if it were my
mamma, but I could not get to her. I
came along by a piece of tile. Being tired
and worn out, as that was the first clean
thing I had seen I clutched to it, thinking
that after I had rested a few moments I
could go on. But I found that I could
not loosen myself. Looking around, I
could see tile after tile looking like they
had just been scrubbed. Just like my
piece, every one was soon thickly covered
with &lsquo;spat,&rsquo; as the oystermen called us.
As fretting has no part in an oyster&rsquo;s life
we contented ourselves thinking that we
might in some way again get loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said one, &lsquo;some of those
big things we saw may come along and
brush some of us off.&rsquo; &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said
another, &lsquo;the owner may take up his tile
and clean it off for other use some day;
it certainly is of no use with us crowding
on it.&rsquo; So we lived in hope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;How large were you?&rdquo; asked Willis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can not tell how fast I grew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Book again made himself useful. &ldquo;Men
who have watched and measured their
growth claim that at two weeks of age
a young oyster is as large as a pinhead;
at that of three months as large as a pea.
Its shell grows about an inch in diameter
each year for the first three years. After
that its size does not increase so fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Oyster again resumed her story.
&ldquo;At last one day they said that we would
soon be large enough for &lsquo;seed.&rsquo; A few
days later we found ourselves broken off
from our clutching places and shut up in
some dark place. The next thing we
knew we were being lowered on a sandy
bottom not so deep down as our old
home. Now, when we catch and grow
on something we like a vertical position.
At first our two valves are alike, but in
time the left one becomes more convex.
If the shell of one of us becomes so
heavy that it breaks off, the convex side,
in dropping, goes to the bottom. When
they planted us the men were kind
enough to lay us in that position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was about a year old I began
to spawn. It is needless to say that
I lived over again the sad experiences of
my poor mother. Some of the spat attached
themselves to my shell and I
gladly adopted them. For a while we
were very happy. Then one day, those
great iron tongs again disturbed us. The
&lsquo;seed&rsquo; were broken off and I was replaced
childless. Next time I spawned I understood
what it all meant. I begged my
second set of adopted children if one of
them ever had a chance to do so to send
me a message. I lived with the great
hope that I might be allowed to remain
there until I had heard from some of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear from any of
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From only two of my great family, but
other oyster mothers have not had even
that much good luck. One day a diving
bird came along hunting me. He said
that another bird with great strong
wings had a message for me from one of
my children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How excited I became! One of my
stolen children had been seen at the
New York harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two years later,&rdquo; continued
Mrs. Oyster, &ldquo;a fish brought me a letter.&rdquo;
Taking a crumpled paper from out of her
pocket and wiping her watery eyes on
her mantle frill she read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mamma:</p>
<p>I have begged one of the students to
write this. When he goes fishing again
he will try to find a fish who will promise
to take it to you.</p>
<p>Since I was torn away from you I
have been in several places. I am now
a fine oyster&mdash;a &ldquo;beauty,&rdquo; I heard some
one say. I am at present in a great
building called a college. Another of
those wise men who look at you through
glasses and whom they call &ldquo;professor&rdquo;
is making plans to analyze several of us
raised in different places. People want
to know, it is said, of what value we are
as food. It breaks my heart to think of
what we must come to.</p>
<p>Farewell,
<span class="lr"><span class="sc">Your Child</span>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Mrs. Oyster again wiped her
eyes Book said, &ldquo;It is too late for me to
tell you much about this Prof. Atwater.
I will only tell that he says that one
quart of oysters contains about as much
nutriment as one quart of milk. As food,
oysters form flesh and make heat and
force in the human body. You can at
any time consult the books farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; said Mrs. Oyster, &ldquo;I was
taken away from my sea home and lived
in a place where the water was nearly
fresh for a little while. After &lsquo;floating&rsquo;
here for a couple of days I was sent to
the market and sold as an extra fine
oyster. They called me a &lsquo;blue point.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Aunt Jennie shook Willis and
asked him why he had not gone to bed.
He rubbed his eyes and looked around,
surprised to see his oyster lying quietly
in its dish, with no snail nor book in
sight.</p>
<p>The next morning he told Joseph and
his aunt about his dream. &ldquo;After this,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;when I wish to know things
which I cannot notice and understand, I
will ask the books. They know so much.
Mrs. Oyster did not get to tell me about
her cousins who make pearls. I mean to
consult some books about them this very
day.&rdquo;</p>

<br />(Harporhynchus redivivus.)

<h2 id="c4">THE CALIFORNIAN THRASHER.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Harporhynchus redivivus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>One of the finest songsters among
birds is the California Thrasher. Though
confined to the coast regions of California,
it is quite abundant and seems to
bear to that locality the same relation
that the brown thrush, or thrasher,
does to the thickets further east. The
song of this Western Thrasher is exquisitely
sweet, and by some it is considered
far superior to that of any of the
numerous songsters that frequent the
woods and brush of the Pacific coast.
These lines, written by Mr. Wasson regarding
the song of the brown thrasher,
apply equally well to the bird of our illustration:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O, hark to the brown thrush! Hear how he sings!</p>
<p class="t">Now he pours the dear pain of his gladness!</p>
<p class="t0">What a gush! And from out what golden springs!</p>
<p class="t">What a rage of how sweet madness!</p>
</div>
<p>It is in the morning and in the evening
that this Thrasher pours forth its
song from some prominent and exposed
perch. Then, as it were, with all care
dismissed from its mind, all the energy
of its being is thrown into a hymn of
nature. By some this song is considered
richer than that of the mockingbirds,
though the Thrasher has but one air.</p>
<p>As a rule the California Thrasher frequents
wooded thickets, though it is often
found in shrubby fields and hedges,
and the dense thickets bordering streams
are especially attractive, for here it finds
the quiet that its nature seems to crave.
Unusually shy and distrustful of man,
it generally avoids his habitations, and,
like the brown thrasher, resents intrusion
with a peculiar and complaining
note. Yet the female is inclined to remain
on her nest and allow close inspection.</p>
<p>Because of its short wings the movements
of this Thrasher are rather heavy.
Its flights are short and usually from
bush to bush, while constantly opening
and shutting its tail. Its life is not confined
to trees and shrubs, for it moves
easily on the ground, hopping rapidly
with accompanying jerks of its tail. It
is said that it will scratch in the layer
of old leaves under trees, like a domestic
fowl when hunting for its food. It
prefers insect food and seldom eats fruit
of any kind, except when food of its
choice is scarce.</p>
<p>Its favorite haunts seem to be the regions
of scrubby oak and greasewood
brush of the deep mountain gorges. Here
it builds its home, which &ldquo;is a coarse,
widely constructed platform of sticks,
coarse grass and mosses, with but a very
slight depression. Occasionally, however,
nests of this bird are more carefully
and elaborately made. It is always
well hid in the low scrub bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the sexes assist in the care of the
eggs, though the male, as befits the father
of a family, usually stands guard over the
nest, giving a quiet note of warning on
the approach of danger. Both sexes are
said to be adepts at misleading an intruder,
for they will fly away from the
nest to the ground or to some thicket at
a distance from their home, and there
by plaintive notes soon attract the intruder,
especially if he is a nest hunter.
In this, as well as in all its habits, it so
resembles the brown thrasher that it
may be considered its representative on
the Pacific Coast.</p>

<h2 id="c6">A QUEER PARTNERSHIP.</h2>
<p>A fine afternoon of that lovely spring
month, May, found me ready for an afternoon
collecting among the birds.
Leaving home, I made my way to the
river bank, and slowly strolled along its
banks, finding much to amuse and interest
me among the birds and flowers, seeing
many old friends and a few new ones.
After going about half a mile, I came to
a well wooded place on one of the banks
where the tall pines found safe homes for
the crows, and a few families were raised
here every year. A little way back,
partly up the hill, was a dead basswood
stump or tree, which contained the
home of a golden-winged woodpecker
or flicker, which I had found a few days
before by seeing the bird leaving the nesting
hole. As the hole was between 30
and 40 feet from the ground, I put on
my climbers and was soon in a position
to investigate; so, seating myself on a
large limb that branched out just below
the nest, I inserted my hand, and got
quite a start on catching hold of some
soft, downy creature, which I thought
must be a squirrel, but imagine my surprise
to find that I had secured an adult
screech owl from out of the woodpecker&rsquo;s
nest. The owl, which had lain quietly
enough in my hands, put an end to my
thoughts by suddenly coming to life, and
very active life at that, and putting its
claws into my hand, prepared to give
itself a good startoff. But I had hold of
its legs, and as I did not like the way it
was holding on, I put it back into the
hole, from which in the meantime I had
taken an egg, which on examining proved
to be the woodpecker&rsquo;s and not an owl
egg. Though the eggs are both white, the
woodpecker&rsquo;s is larger than it is broad
and more of a glossy texture, while the
owl&rsquo;s is nearly round and also much
larger.</p>
<p>Now was the puzzle, what was the
owl doing in the woodpecker&rsquo;s nest,
which was claimed by the latter, as it
had deposited an egg in it, and also was
seen leaving the nest a day or two before.
The only conclusion that I could
arrive at was that the owl had taken
possession for the day and so turned the
woodpecker out.</p>
<p>So far I had not been able to find an
owl&rsquo;s nest, but as I could see by the loss
of feathers that the owl had been setting
I proceeded to try and find the nest, and
decided to try the tree further up; so,
leaving the owl in the flicker&rsquo;s home, I
continued my climb to the top of the
stub, and found the top rotted away, leaving
quite a hollow eighteen inches deep
with a small hole through a rotten place
in the bark, through which I could see
something white, so, carefully putting in
my hands, I was delighted to find four
young owls which were about ten days
old, ugly little things, covered with a
dirty white down, with the feathers just
commencing to show and with their yellow
beaks and large eyes. They did not
look a very interesting pet, but still I
secured two and left two for the mother
owl. I descended the tree and put my
treasure safely away in my collecting bag.</p>
<p>I would like to know how the owl and
flicker arranged the boarding matter, for
I did not get time to go back for a week,
when from the woodpecker&rsquo;s nest I took
six eggs and found the two owlets nearly
ready to fly, but I saw neither of the old
birds. So whether the owl continued to
stay with the flicker or not, or whether
it had just gone for the day, I shall never
know; but still it was interesting to find
the two nests on the one tree within three
feet of each other, one containing eggs
and the other young birds.</p>
<p>The owls that I had taken were safely
reared and prove both amusing and interesting
pets, but their life while in my
keeping we will leave for another time.</p>

</div>
<p>If we desire to study the Broad-tailed
Hummingbird in the regions that it frequents,
we must journey to the mountainous
district of Western North America.
Here it may be found in large numbers,
for it is the most common of all the
species that frequent the mountains. It
seeks its food of insects and honey from
the flowers of a prolific flora extending
from Wyoming and Idaho southward
through Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona,
Texas and over the table lands of
Mexico into Guatemala. It is pretty generally
distributed throughout the various
mountain systems between the eastern
slopes of the Rocky Mountains and the
Sierra Nevadas.</p>
<p>Dr. Merriam found the Broad-tails
very abundant in the balsam and pine
belts of the San Francisco Mountains of
Arizona, where their principal food
plants were the scarlet trumpet flower
and the large blue larkspur. Of their
habits he says, &ldquo;They wake up very early
in the morning and go to water at daylight,
no matter how cold the weather is.
During the month of August, and particularly
the first half of the month, when
the mornings were often frosty, hundreds
of them came to the spring to drink
and bathe at break of day. They were
like a swarm of bees, buzzing about one&rsquo;s
head and darting to and fro in every direction.
The air was full of them. They
would drop down to the water, dip their
feet and bellies, and rise and shoot away
as if propelled by an unseen power. They
would often dart at the face of an intruder
as if bent on piercing the eye with
their needlelike bill, and then poise for a
moment almost within reach before turning,
when they were again lost in the
busy throng. Whether this act was
prompted by curiosity or resentment I
was unable to ascertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems strange and unnatural that
so delicate a bird and one so highly colored
should frequent localities where periods
of low temperature are common.
Yet the Broad-tailed Hummingbird prefers
high elevations and has been known
to nest at an altitude of eleven thousand
feet, and it seldom breeds at places lower
than five thousand feet.</p>
<p>The males leave for their winter homes
very early in the season. Usually this
migration takes place very soon after
the young birds leave their nests. Mr.
Henshaw attributes this movement of the
males to the fact that their favorite food
plant, the Scrophularia, begins to lose its
blossoms at this time. He says: &ldquo;It
seems evident that the moment its
progeny is on the wing and its home ties
severed, warned of the approach of fall
alike by the frosty nights and the decreasing
supply of food, off go the males to
their inviting winter haunts, to be followed
not long after by the females and
young. The latter, probably because they
have less strength, linger last, and may
be seen even after every adult bird has
departed.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Though the flight of all hummingbirds
is rapid, that of this species is unusually
so. During the breeding season, or at
least while mating, the flight of the male
is accompanied by a loud metallic noise.
This is only heard when the bird is rapidly
flying and not when it is hovering
over flowers. Mr. Henshaw suggests
that this sound may be &ldquo;analogous to the
love notes of other birds.&rdquo; Though he
saw &ldquo;many of these birds in the fall, it
was only very rarely that this whistling
note was heard, and then only with greatly
diminished force.&rdquo; He believed that
the sound was produced at the will of the
bird and by means of some peculiar attenuation
of the outer primary wing
feather. The nesting places of many of
the hummingbirds, as well as that of the
Broad-tail, may frequently be located by
the peculiar perpendicular flight of the
male. They will frequently fly as high
as one hundred feet immediately above
the vicinity of the nest, repeating the performance
several times before alighting
on some perch. The female is a faithful
mother and will often remain on her nest
until an intruder is within a few inches.
The nest, though sometimes placed on
large branches, is usually built but a few
feet from the ground in low bushes or
boughs that overhang water.</p>
<p>In their migrations southward the
Broad-tailed Hummingbird is frequently
found in company with the rufous-backed
species, for which it shows an especial
animosity. Speaking of these two species,
Mr. Henshaw says: &ldquo;The beds of
bright flowers about Willow Spring, in
the White Mountains, Arizona, were
alive with them in August, and as they
moved swiftly to and fro, now surfeiting
themselves on the sweets they here found
so abundant, now fighting with each
other for possession of some such tempting
prize as a cluster of flowers, their
rapid motions and the beauty of their
colors intensified by the bright sunlight,
conspired to an effect not soon to be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c8">A BIRD THAT HUNG HIMSELF.</h2>
<p>Near the gate of our garden stands a
small apricot tree which is only about
six feet in height. Last year a long
twine string became entangled in this
tree. One day when I went to the garden
I noticed a blackbird hanging in this
string, about two feet from the ground.
On examination I found that the string
was closely wrapped about his neck several
times, and that he had been choked
to death by it. He had evidently tried
to secure the string for his nest, and probably
had several times started to fly away
with it, only to find that the other end
of it was fast.</p>
<p>There are usually high winds in Kansas
during the Spring months, and these
may have helped to entangle the unfortunate
bird. It is certain that in some
manner he had snared himself, and in
attempting to fly had jerked the cord
tight about his neck. There he hung, a
martyr to his own energy and ambition;
and somewhere his mate mourned for the
partner who had gone from her never to
return.</p>

<h2 id="c10">SOME OF OUR WINTER BIRDS.
<br /><span class="small">IN EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS.</span></h2>
<p>One of our most interesting winter
birds and (with the exception of the
English sparrow) perhaps the commonest,
is the little black-cap chicadee. He is
frequently seen in one&rsquo;s orchard and
around the door, and a stroll into the
woods will reveal him at any time. He
may be easily distinguished by his jet
black cap, his bluish drab back and
wings, and a yellow tinge on his downy
breast. Cedar trees are a special delight
of his and, in the winter season, he may
be found in nearly every grove of these
evergreens. As one walks along through
the woods, he is attracted by their notes,
usually the simple, cheerful &ldquo;chic-a-dee-ee
e e,&rdquo; varied with squeaks and chirps,
or if it be in February or March, he may
hear a beautiful whistle (&ldquo;pee-a-wee-a&rdquo;),
and possibly catch a pretty warbling
song. They are always lively and cheerful
and on a gloomy winter day they
cause one to forget everything but them
and their pleasant notes. They feed principally
on berries and seeds, such as can
be found in cold weather when the
ground is covered with snow. But our
little friends are seldom alone; as almost
constant companions they have the nuthatches,
snowbirds, tree sparrows and
goldfinches.</p>
<p>Another very common cold weather
bird is the slate colored snowbird or
junco. Bluish slate above and grayish
below, with some white tail feathers
which show as he flies, he is a pretty
sight to behold when one starts a flock of
them from some frozen swamp or meadow,
where they feed upon seeds and berries.
They utter a loud chirp when you
disturb them in the winter time, and as
they hop about keep up an incessant twittering,
which are the only notes you will
hear from them, unless you are lucky
enough to hear their song which they seldom
sing before starting for their summer
homes. When it is stormy or severely
cold they come up to one&rsquo;s door and eat
bread crumbs and other things which
may be thrown out. They are real friendly
and will come quite near to you, and a
man once told me that the reason for this
was blindness on the part of the birds,
and even as he spoke one of the birds flew
to a nearby fence and, cocking his head,
looked my informer over as if to give
him the lie. John B. Tabb has written a
short poem, which nicely describes him:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When snow, like silence visible,</p>
<p class="t">Hath hushed the summer bird,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy voice, a never frozen rill</p>
<p class="t">Of melody, is heard.</p>
<p class="t0">But when from winter&rsquo;s lethargy</p>
<p class="t">The buds begin to blow,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy voice is mute, and suddenly</p>
<p class="t">Thou vanishest like snow.</p>
</div>
<p>The tree sparrow, one of our most interesting
sparrows, is another bird who
does not fear the winter winds and
storms. Although he carries the name
of tree sparrow, he is most emphatically
a bird of the ground, and may be seen
during the winter months in almost any
remote patch of plowed ground where
there are old weed stalks for him to eat.
They are especially addicted to old tomato
fields and seem to delight in the seeds
of this plant. This sparrow looks like a
large chippy, our door yard neighbor of
the summer months, excepting that he
has distinguishing white bars across his
wings. They travel in large flocks, and
where one sees a few of them scratching
in the snow, a step too close will scare
dozens of them away. They associate
considerably with snowbirds and where
there are members of one family you will
most always find the others either with
them or close by.</p>
<p>One of our prettiest winter birds is the
downy woodpecker, his glossy black and
white, with the bright red spot on his
head, showing up strongly from some
tree trunk, where he raps for insects, as
he goes up, propping himself with his tail
as he works. One notices him by hearing
his rapping on a branch or his loud note,
which he utters frequently. He delights
in boring holes in trees and, especially in
the spring, he drills out complete nests
which he probably has no intention of
ever using. The hairy woodpecker has
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
almost precisely the same habits and colors
as the downy, and differs only in size.
He, also, is one of our winter residents,
but not so commonly as the other.</p>
<p>The flicker or yellow hammer is
another woodpecker that is with us in
winter as well as summer. He varies
somewhat from the rest of his family in
habits, in that, he feeds considerably on
the ground, consuming a large number of
ants. He is quiet during the winter, but
his loud and cheerful notes are one of the
first bird songs of spring.</p>
<p>A bird which resembles the woodpecker
in his method of feeding, is the
brown creeper, a pretty little brown bird,
with a long curved bill and long sharp
claws, who spends most of his time in
climbing trees. Unlike a woodpecker, he
goes up the trunk by going spirally
around it, thus going over the whole tree
before he flies to the next one and repeats
the operation. The color of his
back closely resembles the bark of a tree,
and when disturbed he will sometimes
crouch close to the tree where it is almost
impossible to see him. In the spring, before
departing north to breed, they often
sing their pretty tune to us, which, however,
we are lucky to hear. In the coldest
weather they are frequently seen on trees
by the wayside, and I have seen them on
Boylston street, Boston, as busy and contented
as ever.</p>
<p>The nuthatch is another bird which
climbs, and, unlike either the woodpeckers
or creepers, he goes down the tree
head first, instead of backing down, and
for this reason has been nicknamed
&ldquo;Devil Downhead.&rdquo; There are two nuthatches
which are fairly common during
the winter months, the white-breasted
and the red-breasted. The former more
commonly frequents orchards and the
roadside, while the latter prefers to frolic,
with the chicadees, among the evergreens.
They seldom stay with us in the summer,
usually nesting farther north.</p>
<p>The goldfinch is also a regular winter
visitor; but at this season he has none of
his bright colors of the summer time; but
is a plain little olive green bird, with dark
wings and a gray breast. They feed
considerably on thistles, but when the
snow falls they take whatever berries
they can find. I remember seeing four or
five of them, one day two winters ago,
coming up and feeding upon the berries
of a honeysuckle vine near my window,
and at another time I saw them eating
with chicadees in some cedars.</p>
<p>Cedar birds, although they do not stay
with us any length of time, may be seen
at different periods during the winter.
They are very pretty birds, being brownish
drab above and sulphur yellow below,
while the wings are marked by spots of
bright red. They travel in very large
flocks and soon have one locality completely
cleared of food, when they depart
elsewhere. One is first attracted by their
peculiar lisping notes, which, coming
from so many throats, make quite a
noise, and upon looking up, he will see
them perhaps in flight or more probably
roosting on the branches of some elm or
oak; or flitting about a cedar, stripping
it of its berries. They are also great
lovers of cherries, and when this fruit is
ripe they may be seen in large numbers
in some orchard.</p>
<p>A journey into the woods on a cold
winter day may reveal to one a flock of
small birds, which have the appearance
of a lot of sparrows which had been dyed
purple, the colors of the sparrow plainly
showing, beneath the purple tinge or
wash on their backs and heads. These
are lesser redpoll linnets. Very hard
working little birds, that usually delight
in the arctic regions, we see them only
when the severest cold drives them south.
They fly in very large flocks, and Miss
Blanchan says of them, &ldquo;First, we see a
quantity of dots, like a shake of pepper,
in the cloud above, then the specks grow
larger and larger, and finally the birds
seem to drop from the sky upon some tall
tree that they completely cover&mdash;a veritable
cloudburst of birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red crossbill is a similar bird to the
redpoll, but is larger and has the two
mandibles of his bill crossed, by the
means of which he extracts the seeds
from the pine cones. We only see him
in the coldest winters, but then he is very
tame and may allow one to pick him
up, and he has even been known to stay in
a cage without a murmur.</p>
<p>These are all our important winter
birds, but the robin and bluejay might
be mentioned although they are more
birds of the summer than winter.</p>

<p class="lr">&mdash;<span class="sc">James Whitcomb Riley</span>, &ldquo;A Vision of Summer.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The Broad-winged Hawk has a wide
range, including the whole of North
America, east of the great plains and extending
from New Brunswick and the
Saskatchewan region on the north to
Northern South America on the south.
It nests throughout its range within the
borders of the United States.</p>
<p>Its confidence in man is not surpassed
by that of any other hawk. Dr. Fisher
says that &ldquo;of all our hawks this species
seems to be the most unsuspicious, often
allowing a person to approach within a
few yards of it, and when startled flies
but a short distance before it alights
again.&rdquo; As a rule it is a very quiet bird,
but during the nesting period it is fully as
noisy and demonstrative as are many
of the other hawks. If disturbed while
on its nest its shrill call notes will soon
attract its mate, when both will continue
noisily complaining till the intruder retreats.
Though solicitous for their eggs
or young, they will never attack a person.
It is said that &ldquo;for days after they
have been robbed these birds will utter
their complaints when anyone approaches
their homes.&rdquo; They are good parents,
both sexes assisting in the care of the
eggs and young.</p>
<p>Not infrequently this Hawk will sit
for hours on the dead top of a tall tree
at the edge of a forest, and with its body
erect and motionless will often seem almost
a part of the tree. Its food is usually
procured on the ground, and it is
near the ground or among the denser
growths of the forest, where it may find
insect larv&aelig;, that it is more often seen.</p>
<p>The Broad-winged Hawk may truthfully
be called a friend of the agriculturist,
for it seldom feeds on bird life of any
kind, but rather upon mice and other rodents,
toads, frogs and insects.</p>
<p>Dr. Fisher, in his valuable work, &ldquo;The
Hawks and Owls of the United States,&rdquo;
says: &ldquo;The only act of the Broad-winged
Hawk which seems injurious to agriculture
is the killing of toads and small
snakes, the former of which are exclusively
insect eaters, the latter very largely
so. In one respect its enormous value
ranks above all other birds, and that is
in the destruction of immense numbers
of injurious larv&aelig; of large moths, which
most birds are either unable or disinclined
to cope with.&rdquo; In the examination
of stomachs of sixty-five of these Hawks
Dr. Fisher obtained the following results:
Two contained small birds; fifteen
contained mice and thirteen other
mammals; in eleven the remains of reptiles,
and in thirteen batrachians were
found; thirty contained the remains of
insects, two earthworms, four crawfish
and seven were empty. The results were
surely in favor of the bird. Well may
the farmer listen to the words of Alexander
Wilson:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Kill not thy friend, who thy whole harvest shields,</p>
<p class="t0">And sweeps ten thousand vermin from thy fields.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The poultry yard is safe from the depredations
of these quiet birds, which,
though sluggish and heavy in flight, can
move with great rapidity and soar high
in the air if they so desire. Even the
small birds in the woods seem to consider
them to be harmless, for they give them
but little attention. When this bird does
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
attack small birds it is either, as a rule,
when they are very young or injured in
some manner.</p>
<p>Its nest is usually made of sticks and
twigs and lined with soft fibrous strips
of bark, leaves and feathers that fall from
the breasts of the setting birds. The
nests are placed in either evergreen or
deciduous trees, and seldom more than
thirty or forty feet from the ground.
They are frequently much lower and occasionally
in the tops of very tall trees.
They have been known to use the deserted
nests of other birds, especially that
of the crow, which is nearly as large as
their own structure.</p>
<p>Dr. Fisher says that one of its notes
quite closely resembles that of the wood
pewee. Another writer says that &ldquo;their
call note is a peevish &lsquo;chee-e-e-e,&rsquo; prolonged
at pleasure and uttered in a high
key. However, to fully appreciate their
shrill note of complaint it must be heard.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Spring in California&mdash;soft, warm, full
and bounteous. Birds twittering and
building nests everywhere.</p>
<p>In February the poppies bloom in
splendor, and no season of the year is so
beautiful, so radiant with glory as the
poppy time. Coming after a spell of
rainy weather, when the mists have lifted
from the face of nature, they usher in the
long summer.</p>
<p>In California the interest centering in
the poppy is universal, and it is the most
beautiful of California&rsquo;s flora. It is the
favorite flower, being the State flower,
suggestive in color, divine in inspiration
and poetry, besides the precious gold and
orange to be found in this land.</p>
<p>The naturalist Adalbert von Chamisso
arrived at San Francisco in 1816 on
the ship Rurick. Seeing the poppy for
the first time, he christened it Eschscholtzia
(esh-sholts-i-a), after Herr Eschscholtz,
his friend and companion of the
ocean journey. The Spanish people call
it El oro de copo (the cup of gold).</p>
<p>This poppy grows in portions of Oregon,
Arizona and Mexico, but in California
it has a beauty such as you can
find nowhere else.</p>
<p>They grow about one foot high. The
cups of gold rest on slender, graceful
stems; the foliage delicate and olive green
in color. This royal poppy is rich in coloring,
cool and refreshing in the midst
of tropical heat. It is one of the most
characteristic and beautiful features of
California&rsquo;s scenery. Associated with it
are sunny skies, beauty, sea breezes and
waving palms.</p>
<p>Under the sun of a bright day the
scene is like an Italian landscape&mdash;a blue
sky without a cloud. The eye wanders
here and there to the gold spread far and
wide, and the question rises, Was there
ever such flowers as these? Myriads of
rich, gorgeous, brilliant poppies nod,
lean, dance and swing their dainty cups
of gold in the breeze. A mass of tossing
gold, sheets of gold fire running up the
valley, hill slopes and mountains. The
pasture, mesa and uplands are all aglow.
Poppies everywhere, found along the sea-shore
in great patches, by the roadside,
hid in the fence corners, in the green
grass, at the edge of the woods, in the
deserts and waste places. They appear
like unfurled banners of a victor
army, like waving billows in the breeze,
like a golden sea, rippling against a blue
horizon.</p>
<p>They are the flowers, around which the
tourists linger, and they go into raptures
over them. Gathered by armfuls, they
are carried to hotels and pressed in
books, then taken East, as souvenirs of
this sunny land.</p>
<p>On &ldquo;Poppy Day&rdquo; the desks in the
schools, the tables and mantels in the hotels
are decorated with bouquets of the
golden blossoms.</p>
<p>Children worship them in their delight
and greet one another with &ldquo;The
poppies are in bloom!&rdquo; then scamper off
by dozens to the mesas, where they deck
their hair with poppy garlands and race
to and fro like butterflies, wading knee-deep
in poppy dust of gold.</p>
<p>Above their happy voices the songs of
the meadow larks can be heard, clear,
mellow and thrillingly sweet.</p>
<p>A golden spell lingers around the
scene, an influence that penetrates the
soul.</p>

<h2 id="c14">QUARTZ.</h2>
<p>The crypto-crystalline (obscurely crystalline)
varieties of Quartz are many.
The following may be named as the most
important: Chalcedony, carnelian, sard,
chrysoprase, prase, plasma, bloodstone,
agate, onyx, sardonyx, jasper, basanite,
flint and hornstone. The distinctions between
the different varieties are loose
and are differently stated by different authorities.
Some class agate, onyx, sardonyx,
plasma and carnelian together as
varieties of chalcedony, while others consider
chalcedony a simple variety. The
chalcedonic varieties of quartz agree in
having a fibrous structure and in being
somewhat softer (hardness 6&frac12;) and
somewhat lighter (specific gravity 2.6)
than crystallized quartz. They also
break with more difficulty than quartz,
being very tough. The varieties differ
among themselves, chiefly in color.</p>
<p>Common chalcedony has a waxy luster
and is usually translucent rather than
transparent. The transparent forms are
known as &ldquo;oriental,&rdquo; the translucent as
&ldquo;occidental&rdquo; chalcedony. Common chalcedony
has little color, shades of gray
and blue being the most common, although
other tints occur. It usually presents
rounded surfaces which have grape-like,
kidney-like or stalactitic forms. It
occurs coating other rocks or minerals
or lines cavities or fills veins and clefts.
It is never, so far as we know, deposited
in any other way than by percolating
waters. At Tampa Bay, Florida, the
waters containing chalcedony have penetrated
corals and preserved them, often
giving forms showing the shape of the
coral outside and a cavity within.
Throughout the &ldquo;Bad Lands&rdquo; of the
West, clefts in the hills are often filled
with sheets of chalcedony varying in
thickness from that of thin paper to
nearly an inch. These chalcedony veins
ramify in all directions and often extend
for many rods without interruption.</p>
<p>When the chalcedony is penetrated by
branching forms of manganese or iron
oxide the forms known as &ldquo;mocha
stones&rdquo; and &ldquo;moss agates&rdquo; are produced.
These are not due to vegetation any
more than the similar forms of frost on
our window panes. They are purely
mineral in their origin. Moss agates
are found in numerous localities in the
States of Utah, Wyoming, Colorado and
Montana. In the opinion of Mr. George
F. Kunz &ldquo;no stone that is used in jewelry
in the United States is cheaper, more
beautiful or more plentiful than the moss
agate.&rdquo; The best occur as rolled pebbles
in the beds of streams. The name,
&ldquo;Mocha stone,&rdquo; sometimes applied to
moss agates is either due to the fact
that those first used came from Mocha
in Arabia, or it is a corruption of the
word moss agate. The finest moss agates
now known come from India. A white
variety of chalcedony containing minute
blood red spots is known as St. Stephen&rsquo;s
stone. Chalcedony was formerly used
much more and more highly prized than
at the present time. It was especially
employed for seals and rings, but also
for plates, cups and vases. These were
often engraved in the most elaborate
manner, the hardness and toughness
of the stone making it well adapted for
this purpose. The sentiment of the stone
is: &ldquo;A disperser of melancholy.&rdquo; The
name chalcedony is from Chalcedon, a
city in Asia Minor, where the original
chalcedony was found. This mineral
was probably not like our modern chalcedony,
however, being more probably
a green quartz. This chalcedony is mentioned
as one of the foundation stones of
the Holy City in the Book of Revelations.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Carnelian is a red variety of chalcedony,
sard a brown variety. All gradations
between these shades of course occur,
those of the reddish cast being the
most common. The most highly prized
color for carnelian is a deep blood red,
appearing darker red in reflected light.
The lighter red and yellowish shades are
less desirable, stones of these shades being
known as &ldquo;female carnelians,&rdquo; while
those of the darker shades are known as
&ldquo;male&rdquo; carnelians. The colors are due
to oxides of iron and can sometimes be
changed by heating. Thus the yellowish
and brownish carnelians being colored by
iron hydroxide can be changed by heating
to red, the water being driven off and
iron oxide left. The heating may be
done in the sun or by some other slow
means. Even olive green stones are
changed in India to red by this process.
The color may also be introduced artificially
by allowing the stones to lie in a
mixture of metallic iron and nitric acid,
or of iron sulphate for a while. In this
way the iron salt needed for the coloring
matter can be absorbed by the stone and
this is changed afterwards to oxide by
heating. The best carnelians come from
India, but good stones are also obtained
in Siberia, Brazil and Queensland. Carnelians
are cut usually in oval and shield-like
shapes and were much employed by
the ancients for intaglios. They believed
them to have the power of preventing
misfortune and they were much worn as
charms.</p>
<p>Sard of typical brown color is much
rarer than carnelian and possesses a high
value. In other respects it is like carnelian.
The sardius mentioned in the
Bible as forming one of the stones of the
High Priest&rsquo;s breastplate was undoubtedly
a carnelian. The name was derived
from Sardius, a city of Lydia whence
fine carnelians are obtained. The name
carnelian is according to some authorities
derived from the Latin word caro, carnis,
flesh, and refers to the color of the
stone, or according to others it is from
the Italian word carniola which has the
same meaning.</p>
<p>Chrysoprase and Prase are terms applied
to an apple green to bright green
chalcedony or compact, jasper-like form
of quartz. Some authorities, however,
call the green chalcedony plasma and restrict
the term chrysoprase to the green
compact quartz. The terms cannot be
accurately distinguished. Most chrysoprase
now in use comes from localities
in the province of Silesia in Germany,
where it occurs in thin layers and veins
in serpentine. The green color here is
due to nickel oxide which is present in
the stone to the amount sometimes of one
per cent. The first discovery of the stone
is said to have been made by a Prussian
officer in 1740. The stone was especially
fancied by Frederick the Great so that he
had two tables made of it and used it
frequently in mosaics. The color fades
with light and heat, but it is said can be
restored by burying the stone in moist
earth for a time. Beautiful chrysoprase
comes from India and there are a few localities
in our own country where it is
found, it being usually associated with
nickeliferous deposits. The name chrysoprase
comes from two Greek words
meaning golden leek and refers to the
color of the stone.</p>
<p>Plasma, as already stated, is a name
applied to green chalcedony, or by some
to green jasper. The name comes from
the Greek for image and shows that the
stone was largely used for seals and
other engraved work. Most of that
known at the present time comes from
India and China.</p>
<p>Bloodstone is a variety of plasma containing
spots of red jasper looking like
drops of blood. Another name for bloodstone
by which it was chiefly known by
the ancients is heliotrope. This name is
derived from two Greek words meaning
&ldquo;sun turning&rdquo; and refers to the
belief that the stone when immersed
in water changes the image of the sun
to blood red. The stone was often used by
the ancients for carvings representing
the head of Christ, and one fine
specimen of such work may be seen
in the Field Columbian Museum. The
ancients had a tradition that the stone
originated at the crucifixion of Christ
from drops of blood drawn by the
spear thrust in his side falling on a
dark green jasper. The stone takes a
beautiful polish. To be of the best quality
it should have a rich dark green
color and the red spots should be small
and uniformly distributed. The supply
is obtained almost wholly from India,
especially from the Kathiawar Peninsula
west of Cambay, whence agate,
carnelian and chalcedony are also obtained.
Fine examples have also come
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
from Australia and a few from Brazil.
In present usage bloodstone is the &ldquo;birth
stone&rdquo; of the month of March.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Who on this world of ours their eyes</p>
<p class="t0">In March first open shall be wise,</p>
<p class="t0">In days of peril firm and brave</p>
<p class="t0">And wear a bloodstone to their grave.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Agate was described in the June number
of this magazine.</p>
<p>Onyx and sardonyx are varieties of
agate in which the layers are in even
planes of uniform thickness. This structure
enables the stone to be used for engraving
cameos. As is well known, these
are so made that the base is of one color
and the figure of another. This art of
making cameos reached a high degree of
perfection among the Romans and many
superb examples of it have come down
to us. The word onyx means a nail (finger
nail) and refers to some fancied resemblance,
perhaps in luster, to the
human nail. Sardonyx is a particular
variety of onyx in which one of the layers
has the brown color of sard. Other
kinds of onyx are those known as chalcedonyx
and carnelionyx in reference to
the color of the intervening layers. So-called
Mexican onyx is composed of quite
a different mineral from the onyx here
considered, it being made up of calcite
rather than quartz. Mexican onyx can
be scratched easily with a knife while
quartz onyx cannot. Mexican onyx has,
however, the banded structure of quartz
onyx and it is in allusion to this undoubtedly
that the name has been applied. A
sardonyx upon which Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s
portrait was cut constituted the stone of
the famous ring which she gave the Earl
of Essex as a pledge of her friendship.
It will be remembered that when the
Earl was sentenced to death he sent this
ring to his cousin, Lady Scroop, to deliver
to Elizabeth. The messenger by
mistake gave it to Lady Scroop&rsquo;s sister,
the Countess Nottingham, who being an
enemy of the Earl&rsquo;s did not deliver it to
the Queen and the Earl was executed.
On her deathbed the Countess confessed
her crime to the Queen, who was so infuriated
that she shook her, saying &ldquo;God
may forgive you, but I cannot.&rdquo; The
onyx is the emblem of conjugal felicity
and by some is made the &ldquo;birth stone&rdquo; of
the month of July. It is one of the stones
prescribed for the ephod of the Jewish
High Priest.</p>
<p>The sardonyx was supposed by the
ancients to be a different stone from the
onyx. To it was ascribed the property
of conferring eloquence upon its wearer.
It is mentioned in Revelations as one of
the stones forming the foundations of the
Holy City. Onyx and sardonyx which
come from the Orient are esteemed of
much higher value in trade at the present
time than those prepared in Germany.
There seems to be no good reason for
this, however, as the latter can be so
skillfully made that it is impossible to
distinguish them from the Oriental
stones.</p>
<p>Jasper is a name which includes in general
nearly all varieties of impure opaque
colored crypto-crystalline quartz. In
color it may be red, yellow, green, brown,
bluish and black. To many of the pebbles
found on almost any sea or lake
shore or in the beds of streams the name
jasper may properly be applied. If it occurs
banded, that is, in stripes of different
colors, it is known as ribbon jasper.
The different colors of jasper are due to
the different impurities it contains. These
may be clay, iron oxides or organic matter
and at times reach a quantity as high
as twenty per cent. The color often varies
irregularly in a single stone, giving different
effects and sometimes imitating
paintings. Jasper which can be used in
the arts is very widely distributed. Good
red jasper is obtained in Breisgau and
near Marburg in Germany. Much of
the brown jasper comes from Egypt.
What is known as &ldquo;Sioux Falls jasper&rdquo;
from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, is
chiefly of a brown color. This stone was
highly prized by the Indians for its color
and is the &ldquo;jasper&rdquo; referred to by Longfellow
in Hiawatha:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;At the doorway of his wigwam</p>
<p class="t0">Sat the ancient Arrow-maker</p>
<p class="t">In the land of the Dacotahs,</p>
<p class="t">Making arrow-heads of jasper</p>
<p class="t0">Arrow-heads of chalcedony.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The yellow jasper used for mosaics
comes chiefly from Sicily, but as good
could be obtained in many places in our
own country. The green jasper of the
present time is obtained chiefly in the
Urals and is to a considerable extent
worked there into ornamental pieces. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
Chinese prize green jasper highly, the
seal of the Emperor being made from it.
Some jasper of a bluish shade is found
in Nature, but that of a deep blue tinge
is always artificially colored by Prussian
blue. It is then sometimes known as
&ldquo;false lapis,&rdquo; that is, false lapis lazuli.
Ribbon jasper is found in Saxony, but
chiefly comes from the Urals. The qualities
which make jasper of use in the arts
are its color, opacity and capacity for taking
a polish. At the present time it is not
much used except for mosaic work and
for small boxes, vases and dishes. The
ancients, however, prized it highly and
used it extensively. It is one of the
stones prescribed in the Book of Exodus
to be worn in the ephod of the High
Priest and also forms one of the gates
of the Holy City as described by St. John
in Revelations. It is probable that the
jasper referred to in these instances was
of a dark green color, as this was the tint
most prized in early times. Green jasper
was also called emerald in some instances.
The banded varieties were much
used for cameos, specimens of which are
still extant. By taking advantage of the
colors of the different layers, colored objects
were made, such as one which
shows the head of a warrior in red, his
helmet green and breastplate yellow.</p>
<p>Basanite is also known as Lydian
stone or touchstone on account of its use
for trying the purity of metals. Its value
for this purpose depends on its hardness,
peculiar grain and black color. Different
alloys of gold give different colors on the
stone which one soon learns to recognize,
and jewelers become very skillful
in judging of the fineness of gold by this
test. Also if an object is plated, by giving
it a few strokes on the stone the different
color of the gold and base will be
revealed. It is simply a black variety
of crypto-crystalline quartz, differing
from jasper in being tougher and of finer
grain and from hornstone in not being
splintery.</p>
<p>Flint is likewise an opaque quartz of
dull color. It differs from jasper in
breaking with a deeply conchoidal fracture
and a sharp cutting edge. It is also
often slightly transparent and has a
somewhat glassy luster. These properties
have led to its extensive use by the
Indians and by nearly all primitive peoples
for the manufacture of weapons and
implements. Hornstone is more brittle
than flint and has a splintery rather than
a conchoidal fracture. A number of other
subvarieties of crypto-crystalline quartz
occur, but they are not important.</p>

<h2 id="c16">A CATASTROPHE IN HIGH LIFE.</h2>
<p>Tertius, as his name signifies, was the
third Maltese cat to occupy a very warm
place in the hearts of a certain pet-loving
family that lived on a quiet, tree-shaded
street in a beautiful Eastern city.</p>
<p>His predecessors were both noted for
their wonderful sagacity and great
achievements, so he felt that he must improve
all his opportunities if he was to
keep up to their high standard. Just
how they had obtained their reputation
he did not know, and perhaps it was this
ignorance that caused him to make his
fatal mistake.</p>
<p>The beautiful house in which he lived
had a large veranda on one side, over
which ran a grapevine, and in this grapevine
a pair of robins, most unwisely, decided
to build their nest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very beautiful spot,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that arrangement in the center
there will be splendid to lay the foundation
on,&rdquo; replied Mr. Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so picturesque,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
R., in a rapture of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there will be such a nice shade
for you, my dear, when the leaves are
out,&rdquo; added the thoughtful husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a much finer situation than Mr.
and Mrs. English Sparrow have for their
nest in the eaves up above. Don&rsquo;t you
think so, Rob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do, wifey; but we must to
work, for the morning is advancing.
Now, you stay here, while I fly off and
get the material.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a very few days as pretty a little
nest was in the spot selected as you would
want to see. Mr. Robin had brought all
the material, while his helpful little wife
had constructed the nest.</p>
<p>All this time their movements had been
watched by the large, admiring, but
greedy eyes of the ambitious Tertius, and
one morning the chance he had so patiently
waited for came. Mr. Robin started
out, thinking in his kind little heart
that he would get &ldquo;little wifey&rdquo; a particularly
large and tasty worm for her
breakfast, and he was so intent in scratching
in the newly turned garden for it that
he did not see the slyly, softly creeping
Tertius. One bound, and poor little Rob
was caught. He screamed, he scolded,
but all to no purpose. Now was Tertius
proud. He would carry his prize to his
mistress, and she would surely say that
his skill and prowess was far beyond that
of either of his illustrious ancestors. So,
thinking, with arched back and curling
tail, he hastily gained the house and at
once carried his prize to his mistress&rsquo;
room. But alas for his well-laid plans!
Alas for the praise he had looked for!
Instead, to his intense surprise and anger,
he was greeted with a cry of pain
and alarm. The mistress who should
have praised rated him well, the hand
that should have stroked his smooth coat
wrenched his prize from him. In his
anger he tried to scratch her in return,
but she had been too quick for him, and
Robin was saved. Tenderly he was laid
in a bed of cotton and placed on an upper
veranda, once more in the sweet, balmy
air. Cautiously he lifted his head, and
as no shining green eyes or sharp paw
were to be seen, ventured to hop to the
edge of the basket in which his kind preserver
had placed him. One more look
around and he stretched out his wings
and soared away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear Rob! I heard your cry.
Where have you been? Do tell me all
about it!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Robin on Mr.
Robin&rsquo;s return, and he, in a most graphic
manner, granted her request; but, as we
already know all about it, we won&rsquo;t stay
to listen.</p>
<p>As to Tertius, he has decided that to
win his way to fame he must confine
himself in the future to a war on mice.</p>

<h2 id="c17">THE DOMESTIC CAT.</h2>
<p>In the old, old writings of the sacred
Sanskrit language, that ancient language
of the Hindoos, nearly two thousand
years ago reference was made to the Domestic
Cat. And so we know that Cats
existed long ago and are a very ancient
animal. But by means of pictures we
are able trace their origin to still earlier
times, for the Egyptian monuments
abound in pictured Cats, and, stranger
yet, in Egypt are found mummies of both
the domestic and common jungle Cat.
How very important it must have been
considered! Think of burying the body
of every forlorn, luckless Cat, and then
realize the pains taken, not only to give
it a burial, but to preserve it for ages to
come; and this the Egyptians did, for
doubtless it was to them the most sacred
of all sacred animals.</p>
<p>Herodotus says that when one of their
houses was on fire they first thought of
saving the Cat, and afterward considered
the matter of putting out the fire; also
when a Cat died they cut off their own
hair as a sign of mourning. When a person
unintentionally caused the death of
one of these animals he forfeited his life.
We can readily imagine that small boys
did not find amusement in chasing and
plaguing stray Cats at that period of the
world&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>While we really do not absolutely
know where the ancestors of our modern
Cat were found, it is the general opinion
that the Egyptian Cat was the first to be
domesticated and that it gradually spread
northward and eastward and westward,
although the spotted Cats of India may
have had a different origin.</p>
<p>In the tenth century the Cat had
reached Wales, as laws were recorded
fixing the price of Domestic Cats, and
also penalties were fixed for their ill
treatment and killing. After a kitten
caught its first mouse its value was
doubled, and a mother Cat was expected
to have perfect eyes, ears and claws, to
know how to catch mice and how to
bring up her kittens properly.</p>
<p>The Domestic Cat is so common an
animal that we do not realize how very
interesting the study of it may become.
First of all, we must remember that our
pet kittens belong to that important division
of animals known as &ldquo;The Cat
Tribe,&rdquo; and which includes such ferocious
and feared beasts as the lion, the
tiger, the wildcat, the leopard, the panther
and many others less common and
less generally known.</p>
<p>All of these animals are most symmetrical
and graceful; all have the round
head set on a stout neck, the limbs of
moderate length, the long tail and the
soft fur which correspond in general
color to its native surroundings. Because
they are beasts of prey the teeth
are adapted to life-destroying action; the
tongue is thick and muscular, with fine,
horny thorns which point toward the
throat. With these the animal can most
beautifully smooth and dress its hair, as
well as strip the meat from off the bone
when making a meal. The claws, ordinarily
drawn up and out of sight, make
an effective weapon when the angry animal
stretches its paws. On account of
its cushioned feet its step is silent and
stealthy. All Cats can jump many times
their own length, and most species are
great climbers. The sense of hearing is
most acute, and they see well at short
range. The sense of touch is extremely
well developed, and the most sensitive
organ is the whiskers. A Cat with the
whiskers cut off is indeed in a most uncomfortable
position; it is at a loss to
know what to do. The sense of smell is
not very acute.</p>
<p>Our Domestic Cat shares all these
qualities with the other members of the
Cat tribe, but it has many valuable qualities
of its own.</p>
<p>It is much more intelligent than people
are willing to concede. It is often compared
with the dog, but they are so
entirely different that it is an unfair comparison.
The dog becomes very dependent
upon man, while the Cat has kept a
certain amount of individuality and independence
through all its generations of
domestic life. When a Cat is very much
petted it develops an affection for its
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
master, but otherwise it becomes more
attached to the house and locality in
which it lives, preferring to return to its
old home and live among strangers rather
than to follow its owner to a new home.</p>
<p>How remarkable is the fact that no
one can cause a Cat to alight except upon
its feet, no matter how short or long may
be the distance from which it jumps or
is thrown! A Cat can also swim, though
in the main it abhors the water. Occasionally
its great appetite for fish will
overcome its dislike of getting wet, and
it will jump into a pond and do its own
fishing.</p>
<p>Mr. Scheitlin understandingly describes
the Cat in the following language:
&ldquo;The Cat is an animal of a high
order of intelligence. Its bodily structure
alone indicates this. It is a pretty,
diminutive lion, a tiger on a small scale.
It shows the most complete symmetry
of form, no one part of it too large or too
small. That its every detail is rounded
and beautiful is even shown by an examination
of the skull, which is more
symmetrical than that of any other animal.
Its movements are undulating and
graceful to the extent that it seems to
have no bones. We value our Cats too
slightly because we detest their thievish
propensities, fear their claws and love
their enemy, the dog, and we are not
able to show equal friendship and admiration
for those two opposite natures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us examine the Cat&rsquo;s qualities. We
are impressed by its agility, yet its mind
is as flexible as its body. Its cleanliness
of habit is as much a matter of mental
bias as physical choice, for it is constantly
licking and cleaning itself. Every
hair of its fur must be in perfect order;
it never forgets as much as the tip of
its tail. It has a discriminating sensibility
as to both color and sound, for it
knows man by his dress and by his voice.
It possesses an excellent understanding
of locality and practices it, for it prowls
through an entire neighborhood, through
basements and garrets and over roofs
and haysheds without bewilderment. It
is an ideally local animal, and if the family
moves it either declines to accompany
them, or, if carried to a new residence,
returns at the first opportunity to the old
homestead; and it is remarkable how unerringly
it will find its way back, even
when carried away in a sack for a distance
of several miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Large families are the custom with
Cats, for usually five or six kittens are
born at one time. As these cunning little
objects are totally blind for nine days
after birth, the devoted mother Cat must
work industriously to properly care for
them and especially to preserve them
from danger. They must be hidden away
from harm, as the father Cat would be
perfectly willing to devour them, and
would attack them as readily as he would
a rat or a mouse. The mother Cat lifts
her helpless little ones very tenderly by
compressing the skin of their necks between
her lips and gently carries them
to a place of safety.</p>
<p>While attending to the duties of motherhood
the Cat is in a sympathetic frame
of mind and will sometimes care for the
young of other animals as well as for
her own. Mr. Brehm tells us that, when
a boy he brought a little squirrel, yet
blind, to one of his Cats, which accepted
the strange child among her own and
tenderly cared for it, and after her own
kittens had been given away she regarded
it with increased affection. They became
inseparable companions and understood
each other perfectly, though each
talked in its own language.</p>
<p>Cats frequently form friendships for
other animals, and even dogs and Cats
become friendly, in spite of the impression
to the contrary.</p>
<p>While living in a large city where
yards were small and infrequent, I was
the happy owner of a beautiful tree,
which stood near the rear of the house.
There were many pet Cats in the neighborhood,
and all delighted to visit my
tree. Undoubtedly some were attracted
by the English sparrows which were almost
omnipresent among the upper
branches, but all enjoyed clawing,
stretching and scratching up the friendly
trunk. One day a strange kitten appeared,
and although smallest and youngest
of all the Cats, by its superior intelligence
it soon became king among
them and ruled them all, causing many a
commotion in the previously tranquil
group. This young Cat gained entrance
to my next door neighbor&rsquo;s house and
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
made itself at home with an &ldquo;I am come
to stay&rdquo; air. In fact, it refused to be
evicted, and by its determined persistence
became a member of the household.</p>
<p>The other family pet was an old pug
dog&mdash;Jack&mdash;cross and uninteresting,
but tolerated because he gave some
amusement to an invalid daughter of the
family. Jack, jealous and annoyed, received
the newcomer in the most hostile
manner, and the kitten seemed to take
special delight in tormenting the dog in
every possible way. In fact, the lack of
harmony between the pets became so annoying
that it was decided to sacrifice
the kitten, and it was taken to a remote
place. For a number of weeks quiet prevailed
in the rear yards of the neighborhood,
but in time, to everyone&rsquo;s surprise,
the Cat reappeared and refused to be
turned away. Its courage and daring
won recognition, and again it was received
into the family circle. I wondered
what Jack would do now that the
kitten was restored to favor. About this
time business called me from the city,
and some time elapsed before my return.
On reaching home again, one night I
heard the dog crying and whining till
nearly morning. I could not imagine
the cause, but to my astonishment learned
the next day that the dog and Cat had
become such firm friends that the dog
was perfectly inconsolable when the Cat
was absent, and as his kingship had
chosen to wander outside that particular
night, the dog had mourned for hours. In
fact, after causing the family a sleepless
night, his master was obliged to rise and
punish him before he would cease his
cries. Such devotion put to flight all
my previous theories of the inborn antagonism
between Cats and dogs.</p>
<p>The different varieties of Domestic
Cats are distinguished from one another
by the difference of color, length of hair
or, more rarely, length of tail.</p>
<p>The Cats of India are spotted, those
of the Isle of Man are practically tail-less,
but the European Cats are commonly
&ldquo;tabby,&rdquo; black, white, sandy, tortoise
shell, dun, gray or the so-called
blue.</p>
<p>The most beautiful of all are the highly
prized Persian or Angora Cats, with
their long, silky hair and bushy tails.</p>

<h2 id="c19">SOAPWORT OR BOUNCING BET.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Saponaria officinalis.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The plant commonly called Soapwort
or Bouncing Bet also bears other popular
names, many of which are purely local.
Some of these are Hedge Pink,
Bruisewort, Sheepweed, Old Maid&rsquo;s
Pink and Fuller&rsquo;s Herb. It bears the
name Soapwort because of a substance
called saponin which is a constituent of
its roots and causes a foaming that appears
like soap suds when the powdered
root is shaken with water.</p>
<p>Soapwort belongs to a large group
of plants called the Caryophyllace&aelig;, or
pink family. In this family there are
about fifteen hundred species. These
are widely distributed, but are most
abundant in the Northern Hemisphere,
extending to the Arctic regions and to
the tops of very high mountains. The
popular and beautiful carnations and
some of the most common plants that
grow abundantly in waste places also
belong to the pink family. The Soapwort
comes to us from Europe, where in
some localities it is a common wild
flower. In this country when it was first
introduced it was simply a pretty cultivated
garden plant. However, it lives
from year to year and spreads by means
of underground stems. It was not very
long before it had escaped from yards to
roadsides, where frequently large patches
may be seen. The flowers are large and
quite showy. The color of the petals is
usually pinkish white. Blossoming in
July, August and September, the Soapwort
often beautifies waste places which
other plants seem to shun. It is perhaps
more generally loved than any other of
our old-fashioned garden flowers. It
grows luxuriantly without cultivation
and seems to quite hold its own even
among rank growths of weeds and grass.
It is hard to tell what is the significance
of the name Bouncing Bet, perhaps the
most popular of all the names by which
this plant is known.</p>
<p>Alice Lounsberry says: &ldquo;It was always
a mystery to Dickens that a doornail
should have been considered so much
more dead than any other inanimate object,
and it seems also strange that this
plant should have suggested the idea of
bouncing more than other plants. Dear
Bettie does not bounce, nor could she if
she would. She sits most firmly on her
stem, and her characteristics seem to be
home-loving and simple. We are sure
to find her peeping through the garden
fence.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c20">TURTLE-HEAD OR SNAKE-HEAD.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Chelone glabra.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Turtle-head or Snake-head is one
of three species that are natives of eastern
North America. This plant is well
supplied with common names, as it is
also called Shell-flower, Cod-head, Bitter-herb
and Balmony. The generic name of
this flower of the swamps and moist
banks of streams is from the Greek word
which means tortoise, the name having
been given to the plant because of the
fancied resemblance between the flowers
and the head of a turtle or snake. One
may be able, by stretching his imagination,
to see this resemblance in the flowers
of our illustration.</p>

<p>The custom of giving names to plants
that are suggestive of their real or fancied
resemblance to various objects of
nature, or are indicative of their beneficial
or injurious qualities, is as old as
history itself. In this way a large number
of plants have become associated
with good or evil spirits, Christian or
pagan saints or martyrs, animate nature
or some of the phenomena of nature. To
the Indian the likeness of the flower of
the Turtle-head to the head of a reptile
not only gave it its name, but at the
same time invested the plant with certain
sacred associations by reason of the
fact that not only among the Indians of
North America, but among the uncivilized
peoples in all parts of the world
the tortoise has been considered sacred
and highly symbolical.</p>
<p>Though commonly found in low altitudes,
it is found in moist places in the
Adirondacks, even at a height of three
thousand feet.</p>
<p>This plant is not rare, and with its upright
stem and its rather large and clustered
white or slightly rose-colored flowers
it is a dignified and beautiful feature
of any floral community.</p>
<h2 id="c21">THE POCKET BIRD.</h2>
<p>About the middle of May a gaily colored
bird from his winter home in neo-tropical
regions visits the United States.
His body is bright scarlet, his slightly
forked tail and his wings intense black
and his bill sea green. The ornithologist
names him the scarlet tanager&mdash;tanager
being a Brazilian word applied to
this class of birds. But he is also sometimes
called the &ldquo;pocket bird,&rdquo; because
his jetty wings when closed upon his red
sides are fancifully thought to resemble
pockets. He is also known as the black-winged
redbird. It takes three years for
his gaudy plumage to become perfect.
His mate is clad in green, so that she is
easily concealed when on her nest amid
the leaves of the swamp oak or some
other favorite nesting tree. The nest is
shallow and loosely woven, so that the
eggs may be seen from beneath. But it
is strong enough to hold the young birds
securely until fledged. The eggs, three to
five in number, are greenish-blue, spotted
with brown and purple. The young birds
are a clownish looking set in parti-colored
robes of scarlet yellow and olive
green. The song of the tanager somewhat
resembles that of the robin in modulation;
but the quality of the song is so
soft and wavering that there are observers
who call him a lazy bird, too lazy to
sing. But others declare that it is worth
while to take a long tramp in order to
listen to his beautiful notes. Mr. Abbott
calls him a &ldquo;gayly colored blunder&rdquo;
without peculiarity of voice or manner.
His song has been translated &ldquo;Pshaw&mdash;wait&mdash;wait&mdash;wait
for me.&rdquo; His call note
is &ldquo;Chirp-chirr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are some three hundred and
eighty species of tanagers, and they are
peculiar to America. They are perching
birds and have usually conical bills, triangular
at the base, with cutting edges
near the tip of the upper mandible: this
distinguishes them from the finches, to
which they are closely allied. It is said
that this genus is remarkable in having
no gizzard.</p>
<p>The tanagers feed chiefly on ripe fruits
and insects.</p>
<p>The organist tanager of San Domingo
is purplish black, with forehead,
rump and underparts yellow, and a cap
of blue. Its tones are said to be extremely
rich and full. But if our scarlet
tanager is not so fine a musician as his
cousin, if he has no such organ-like
tones, yet we could ill spare the blaze of
his scarlet coat and the sight of his black
pockets, as he sits on the hedge very
early in the morning&mdash;the rising sun emphasizing
his brilliancy. Then he is an
early riser I am sure, as I have seen him
before four o&rsquo;clock in the morning. But
he has always been silent at that time as
if not wide awake yet. In manners he
is a most unobtrusive bird. He is rightly
entitled to some of the plunder of the
fruit trees. For there is no doubt that we
owe all kinds of fruit to the agency of
birds as seed distributors. Besides, the
tanager is very destructive to larvae that
injure fruit.</p>

<h2 id="c22">THE BIRDS IN THEIR WINTER HOME. II.
<br /><span class="small">(In the Fields.)</span></h2>
<p>A half day&rsquo;s tramp through the pastures
and fields of a Mississippi &ldquo;second
bottom&rdquo; any sunshiny day from the first
of December till the first of March will
reveal some of the reasons why this is a
veritable birds&rsquo; paradise in winter. Fields
once in cultivation, but now abandoned to
sedge and Bermuda grass, cultivated
fields, where giant cockle burrs wrestle
with morning glory vines for the possession
of the soil, tracts of palmlike palmeto
and marshy jungles of willows,
pampass grass and briars afford attractive
feeding grounds by day and safe
roosting places by night to myriads of
winter visitants. In such places are found
abundant supplies of the insects, berries
and seeds which this humid, semi-tropical
climate produces in great profusion.
Good shelter and plenty to eat settle the
problem of living for the present for our
little feathered friends.</p>
<p>Walk out on these broad savannas
about the first of February before a tint
of white or pale green has appeared on
the chicasaw plum (Prunus chicasa) and
take note of the abundance and vigor of
bird life before spring has begun to
make serious inroads upon it. In the
drier parts of these lowlands, especially
where stubby plum bushes and haws
abound, our old friend the field sparrow
meets us with the same innocent, confiding
air that we remember as characteristic
of him in the region of Lake Erie and
Lake Michigan. He is one of the birds
that we can talk about in the indicative
mood without &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; or apologies;
the good that he does in disposing of
surplus insect life is not offset by tolls
levied on our ripest and juiciest fruit; he
never goes over to the enemy to plunder
those who trust him. Even the robin,
whose praises are in everybody&rsquo;s mouth,
becomes a pirate when our cherries and
mulberries ripen, and we wish he would
stay away from our premises till the
berry season is over.</p>
<p>The pale red or horn-colored beak of
this bird will help us to distinguish him
from another, often mistaken for him&mdash;the
chippy, or chipping sparrow, a bird
of the same general appearance and size.
Even with the naked eye you can detect
differences enough to distinguish the two
species. Both are small birds with chestnut
or rufous crown caps; the chippy
has a patch of black on his forehead and
bill of the same color; his brother of the
fields wears no black, and his bill, as before
stated, is a pale red or horn color.
In Central Mississippi, as in parts of
Northern Ohio, field sparrows are very
numerous, but chippies quite rare.</p>
<p>In the grass or crouched down close to
the brown earth and gray weed stems we
see another of our friends. With a
&ldquo;chip&rdquo; he jumps up out of the grass and
is away before you can see what particular
shade of gray or brown is most conspicuous.
However, he doesn&rsquo;t fly far,
but suddenly drops into some inviting
tuft, spreading out his tail like a fan as
he does so, as if on purpose to show you
its margin of white. This is the only
one of our common sparrows that shows
the white feather&mdash;the vesper sparrow,
or bay-winged bunting. The field sparrow,
as one authority says, had better
be called the tree sparrow, because of
his marked fondness for bushes and
shrubs, but both of the former&rsquo;s names
fit; he is rightly called the vesper sparrow
from his delightful custom of singing
his choicest hymns to the dying sun,
and bay-winged bunting from the conspicuous
patch of bay or rufous on the
lesser wing coverts.</p>
<p>Sometimes in company with the vespers
we see the slate-colored junco, or
snow bird; at other times a gorgeous, distinguished
looking sparrow, named from
his partiality to these broad, low fields,
the savanna sparrow. He is the dandy
of this winter resort. His plaid coat and
striped shirt eclipse the somber colors of
all his cousins. The epaulettes of gold
on his shoulders indicate his high rank;
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
but for all that he is no dude, for he
works as hard as anybody to find his own
breakfast and enjoys it all the more that
he eats his crickets in the sweat of his
brow. A simple &ldquo;chip&rdquo; is the only remark
he makes to us or to his companions
as he runs along the cotton rows in
quest of food. Ornithologists, however,
tell us that up in Canada in his summer
home he sings a weak, grasshopper-like
song in marked contrast to the musical
efforts of his neutral tinted cousin, the
vesper.</p>
<p>The fields of broom sedge are the favorite
haunts of one of the birds whose
cheerful music and winning ways help
to make June in the North &ldquo;the high tide
of the year, when all of life that has
ebbed away comes rippling back into
each inlet and creek and bay.&rdquo; I never
see the meadow lark or hear his cheery
whistle that I do not smell the blossoming
clover and hear the ringing &ldquo;spink,
spank, spink&rdquo; of the bobolink or catch
the subtle suggestion of strawberries that
comes floating to my nostrils on the warm
June breeze. In a thirty minutes&rsquo; walk
through the sedge I have flushed as many
as two or three hundred of these birds.
They are called &ldquo;field larks&rdquo; by the negroes,
who regard them as legitimate
game. The lark&rsquo;s whistle&mdash;it can hardly
be called a song&mdash;contains a bit of good
advice habitually disregarded by the negroes.
They interpret it as &ldquo;laziness
will kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colored people have an ornithology
all their own, in which their own observations
are strangely mingled with superstition.
They tell us of two kinds of
mockingbirds, &ldquo;de real&rdquo; and &ldquo;de French&rdquo;
varieties. The real mockingbird deserves
an article all to himself. His winning
ways, playful disposition and ability as
a singer give him a place second to none
among our American birds. I am pleased
to see the spirit of Americanism growing
in our literature, that conventional allusions
to the skylark and the nightingale,
birds few of us have ever seen or heard,
are becoming rarer and rarer, while those
to the robin, the mockingbird and the
wood thrush are becoming more frequent.
The mockingbird, like other singers,
does his best during the courting
and nesting seasons, but does not confine
his concerts to that joyous time. On
warm days in winter he loves to perch
in the cedars and give his listeners a
sample of what he can do, an earnest of
the floods of melody that spring will
bring. Balmy air, green of cedar and
water oak and bird music disarrange our
mental almanac. Even the nodding narcissus
contributes to the illusion that it is
not February, but May.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;French mockingbird&rdquo; is no
mockingbird at all, but the logger-headed
shrike, or butcher bird. Like some people,
he tries to occupy a front seat, even
if his music wins for him one of the lowest
seats of the choir. A beanpole in the
garden, the topmost wire of the fence and
the top of a solitary shrub or tree are
alike acceptable to him, for it&rsquo;s all one to
him if he gets to see all that is going on
in his little world. No doubt he does
do mischief during the nesting season,
when eggs or tender nestlings are easier
to find or more acceptable to his fastidious
palate than the mice and insects
which compose his winter diet. Just now
he is a most pleasing bit of decided color,
black, white and blue-gray, very refreshing
to the eye, amid the browns and
grays of last year&rsquo;s vegetation.</p>
<p>When a cold wave comes, what a scurrying
takes place! Each winter visitor
packs his grip and strikes for the nearest
shelter, be it canebrake or swampy jungle,
where tall grass and cat-tails above,
briars and water below, make a retreat
impregnable to assault from the enemy
flying through the air or creeping along
the ground. If the cold wave continues
until the ground freezes the birds suffer.
At such times half-starved robins gorge
themselves on the berries of the China
tree (Melia azederach) and have a general
&ldquo;drunk.&rdquo; They never eat many of
the berries unless they are the only provisions
obtainable, unless driven to it by
stress of the weather, an excuse for
drunks that cannot always be truthfully
given by the lords of creation. While
the silly birds are sitting around trying
to throw off the effects of their debauch
an enemy comes upon the scene. The negroes
take advantage of the robin&rsquo;s disability
to manage his own affairs and
feast high on roast robin, fried robin,
stewed robin, etc., much to the detriment
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
of next spring&rsquo;s music in Northern fields
and orchards.</p>
<p>The warm breath of the Gulf steals in
upon our little world and a change comes.
The birds remember that they are due in
a few days in an Ohio orchard or on an
Illinois prairie, so they pack and go. The
allurements of a Southern spring, with
all its fragrance and charm, do not hold
them. Without a goodby they are gone,
not to return till once more</p>

<h2 id="c23">MUSIC-LOVING FELINES.</h2>
<p>According to observation, music has
power, not only to soothe the savage or
the troubled breast of civilized man, but
its potency extends to the brute world as
well. Among those animals which appear
to be charmed by musical sounds, it
would seem difficult to find any manifesting
a keener delight than the ordinary
domestic cat.</p>
<p>The London Spectator some months
ago referred to an instance where a cat
showed marked pleasure in a whistled
tune. This recalled to memory the circumstance
of a certain cat, a beautiful
creature with black and ecru stripes,
whose appreciation of the musician&rsquo;s art
awakened in him inordinate emotion.
Were he within hearing distance of the
piano the eliciting of a few chords was
sufficient to beguile him into the parlor.
When permitted to walk across the keys
he always appeared pleased with his performance.
But he was discriminating
and exhibited decided preferment for vocal
renditions over instrumental. The
&ldquo;Miserere&rdquo; from &ldquo;Il Trovatore&rdquo; affected
him more deeply than anything else, and
might appear to confirm the theory held
by some that the possession of a soul is
not limited to the human creation.</p>
<p>Settling himself in front of the singer,
he would listen with bated breath and
eyes widely dilated. Never would he
move a muscle, unless after a prolonged
interval in the music, when he would
softly approach the vocalist to caress her
face and neck with his paw or to smooth
her cheek with his own. His coaxings
always had the sought for effect, when
he would once more seat himself with
becoming decorum to imbibe the harmony
which seemed to ravish his being.</p>
<p>This is by no means an isolated instance
of fondness for musical discourse
on the part of cats, though this particular
case affords an extravagant illustration
of that &aelig;sthetic sensitiveness which
characterizes probably the whole feline
tribe.</p>

<p>This highly important plant belongs to
the grass family. It is perennial, with
thick, succulent, jointed rhizomes, having
root tufts at the joints. The stems
are numerous, erect, cylindrical, growing
to a height of six to twelve feet. Like
the rhizome, the stem is jointed, the internodes
being, however, much shorter
toward the base. The leaves are numerous
toward the apex, being deciduous
toward the base. The apical tuftlike inflorescence
is quite characteristic. The
individual flowers are small and unattractive
in appearance. One of the remarkable
things about the plant is that
the fruit never matures. It must be remembered
that the plant referred to is
entirely distinct from the so-called sugar-cane
of the Central States from which
sorghum molasses is made.</p>
<p>It is very doubtful whether sugar-cane
occurs anywhere in the wild state, at
present. Authorities are quite unanimous
in expressing it as their opinion
that its original home was India. It is a
plant that has been under cultivation for
many centuries. Alexander the Great, in
his invasions of India, found that the inhabitants
of that country cultivated and
used it extensively as a food article. Theophrastus
mentions a &ldquo;sweet salt&rdquo;
(sugar) which he obtained by evaporating
the juice of an Indian reedlike plant,
which was perhaps sugar-cane, though
there is no conclusive evidence that the
earlier Greeks and Romans were familiar
with sugar; they employed honey
quite universally. The &ldquo;sweet cane&rdquo; of
Scripture is probably Andropogon calamus
aromaticus, or sweet calamus,
which was a native of India. It is presumed
by some that the cane grown in
China was originally native there. The
cultivation of sugar-cane seems to have
spread very rapidly. It early found its
way to Persia and Arabia, and then from
Arabia as a center has spread to the Mediterranean
districts, Sicily, Cyprus, Spain
and Italy. It found its way to Santo Domingo
as early as 1494 and to Brazil
early in the sixteenth century. At the
present time cane is grown in nearly all
tropical and sub-tropical countries, the
Southern United States producing more
than any other country.</p>
<p>There are many varieties recognized
by cultivators, differing in color, texture
and other minor characteristics.</p>
<p>Since cane does not ripen fruit, it is
propagated by transplanting the rhizomes
and top portions of stem, and after a field
is once planted new crops are permitted
to spring up from the old rhizomes,
and this accounts for the awful tangle of
the famous Southern canebrakes, which
figured so extensively in the slave days,
when these fields served as hiding places
for the fugitive slaves. The ripe cane is
cut close to the ground, the leaves
stripped off and the tassel cut off. It is
then carted to the cane mill and passed
between large rollers, which express the
juice, which is then clarified by means
of lime, animal charcoal and blood. Heat
further aids the purifying process by coagulating
the albuminous matter, which,
mixed with other impurities, rises to the
surface as a scum and is removed by
means of a special ladle. The lime combines
with the free acid present and settles
to the bottom. The juice is boiled
until it acquires a proper tenacity, when
it is passed into a cooler and allowed to
crystallize. This sugar is then placed in
large perforated casks and allowed to
drain for two or three weeks, when it is
packed into hogsheads and exported under
the name of raw sugar or muscovado
sugar. The drainings form molasses.
Raw sugar is taken to the sugar refinery
and purified by heating with water and
bullocks&rsquo; blood, filtered through canvas
bags and finally allowed to percolate very
slowly through large cylinders containing
freshly prepared, coarse-grained animal
charcoal. The filtered liquor is then
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
boiled by the aid of steam. When sufficiently
tenacious it is poured into conical
molds, and when solidified the stoppers
are removed to allow the
treacle to drain off. The loaves from
the molds are then sugared, as it is
called, by pouring over them a saturated
sugar solution, which, by slowly
percolating through them, carries with
it coloring matter and other impurities
without dissolving the sugar crystals.
When a saturated aqueous solution of
sugar is allowed to cool slowly it forms
large, beautiful crystals known as sugar
or rock candy. Caramel is burnt sugar;
it has a peculiar odor and loses its sweet
taste, becoming bitter. It is used largely
as a coloring agent for coloring liquids.</p>
<p>Sugar has innumerable uses. As an
article of food it is not surpassed,
though it cannot support life alone, because
it contains no nitrogen. It is the
important ingredient in candies, pastries,
sweetened drinks, etc. Molasses and
treacle are much used and must not be
confounded with the sorghum molasses
made from the sugarcane of the Central
States. Molasses and treacle sometimes
have a peculiar and to many a very objectionable
flavor, due to impurities present.</p>
<p>Molasses, as well as treacle, when fermented,
gives rise to rum. The popular
notion that sugar is injurious to teeth is
without foundation. It has no action on
teeth whatever. If anything it has anti-septic
properties and preserves the teeth.
It is, however, undoubtedly true that the
excessive consumption of sweets, pastries
in particular, is bad for the digestion, as
externally manifested by a dirty complexion
and skin eruptions. As a whole sugar
by itself is not injurious; it is an excellent
food, a heat producer and easily assimilated.
Americans, especially the
American youth, are the great sugar consumers
of the world.</p>
<p>In medicine sugar is employed to disguise
the taste of disagreeable remedies
and to coat pills. It has no direct curative
properties in disease.</p>
